## **5. Getting Started: Local Setup from Scratch**

To get this project running on your local machine, you need to have `Git` and `Node.js` installed.

### **Prerequisites:**

- **Git:** [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Node.js:** We recommend using a Node Version Manager (**nvm**)
  - For Mac/Linux: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  - For Windows: [nvm-for-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
  - **Recommended version:** `nvm install 22` and `nvm use 22`.
  - **Alternative versions:** Node.js 20.x or 18.x also work.

### **Installation Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/e-commerce-22tt-group03/ecom-frontend
    cd ecom-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:** Install all the necessary libraries:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    _(This may take a few moments)_

3.  **Set up environment variables:** Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project folder. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into it.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open the `.env` file and set the backend API URL.
    ```env
    # This is the local address of our backend server
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

üéâ **You're all set!** The application should now be
running and accessible at **http://localhost:5173**. The page will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source code.

## **6. Project Structure Explained**

Our folder structure is designed for scalability and separation of concerns.

- `public/`: Static assets that are not processed by Vite (e.g., `favicon.ico`).
- `src/`: Contains all our application's source code.
  - `api/`: Axios instance setup and API endpoint definitions.
  - `app/`: Redux store configuration.
  - `assets/`: Images, logos, and other static assets that will be bundled.
  - `components/`: Shared, reusable UI components (e.g., `Button.jsx`, `Modal.jsx`).
  - `features/`: "Smart" components and Redux logic, grouped by application feature (e.g., `auth`, `products`).
  - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
  - `pages/`: Top-level components that correspond to a specific page/route.
  - `routes/`: Main application routing configuration.
  - `utils/`: Helper functions.

## **7. Available Scripts**

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
- `npm run build`: Compiles and bundles the app for production into the `dist/` folder.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to find and fix problems in the code.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally to test it before deployment.

## **8. Environment Variables**

All environment variables used in the frontend must be prefixed with `VITE_`. They are defined in the `.env` file and accessible in the code via `import.meta.env.VITE_VARIABLE_NAME`.
